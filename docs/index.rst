sunkit-instruments
==================

A package for instrument-specific data structures and processing in the SunPy ecosystem.

``sunkit-instruments`` is organised into sub-modules for each instrument:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   code_ref/index
   generated/gallery/index
   whatsnew/index


Note that the code in this package is **not** maintained by or neccesarily contributed by instrument teams.
Some instruments have individual packages for analysis in Python, including:

- `aiapy <https://aiapy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__
- `eispac <https://eispac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
