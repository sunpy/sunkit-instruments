0.6.0 (2025-03-12)
==================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Increased minimum Python version to 3.10 (`#125 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/125>`__)
- Increased the minimum version of ``sunpy`` to 6.0.0. (`#126 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/126>`__)
- Update the hash of the CHIANTI data file retrieved by the data manager used in `sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_temperature_em`
  so that the latest version of the file is used. (`#143 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/143>`__)
- Updated SUVI Flight Model files for FM1 (16) and FM2 (17). (`#168 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/168>`__)


New Features
------------

- Added `sunkit_instruments.response.SourceSpectra` to provide a container for
  spectra as a function of temperature and wavelength needed for computing temperature
  response functions. (`#98 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/98>`__)
- Added `sunkit_instruments.response.abstractions.AbstractChannel` to standardize an interface
  for computing wavelength and temperature response functions. (`#98 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/98>`__)
- Added support for SUVI Flight Models FM3 (18) and FM4 (19). (`#168 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/168>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- In the ``fermi``, the function ``get_detector_sun_angles_for_time`` returns the angle with respect to the Sun of each Fermi/GBM detector.
  However, these files contain gaps due to the South Atlantic Anomaly.
  If the time requested falls in one of these gaps, the code will return the detector angles for the next available time.
  This can be several minutes different from the time requested.
  Now, a warning to the user will be raised if the time returned by the code is more than 1 minute different from the time requested (1 minute is the nominal cadence of the spacecraft weekly file), and explains that this is likely due to a South Atlantic Anomaly encounter. (`#128 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/128>`__)
- The function ``plot_detector_sun_angles`` was broken, due to the formatting of the time axis. (`#130 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/130>`__)
- Fixed a bug in `~sunkit_instruments.lyra.remove_lytaf_events_from_timeseries` where units were not being correctly passed
  to new timeseries. (`#143 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/143>`__)


Documentation
-------------

- Add a topic guide on a vocabulary for instrument response functions. (`#111 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/111>`__)


Internal Changes
----------------

- Re-templated the entire library to use the new sunpy template. (`#133 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/133>`__)


0.5.0 (2023-11-17)
==================

Maintenance release, no new features or bugfixes.

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Increased minimum version of ``sunpy`` to 5.0.0
- Increased minimum version of Python to 3.9

0.4.0 (2023-04-04)
==================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- This removes the older version of `sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_temperature_em` that no longer works for the re-processed netcdf files and new GOES-R data.

  This also removes the ``sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_radiative_loss_rate`` and ``sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_xray_luminosity`` functions that also no longer work in their current form.

  The new `sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_temperature_em` function now returns a new sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries with the temperature and emission measure rather than appending columns to the passed XRSTimeSeries. (`#81 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/81>`__)


Features
--------

- Create new function (`sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_temperature_em`) to calculate the temperature and emission measure from the GOES XRS measurements including the new re-processed XRS data and GOES-R data.

  See :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_calculate_goes_temperature_and_emission_measure.py` for an example. (`#81 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/81>`__)


0.3.0 (2022-05-24)
==================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- Dropped Python 3.7 support. (`#53 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/53>`__)
- Minimum version of ``sunpy`` is now 4.0 (LTS). (`#61 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/61>`__)


Features
--------

- Added functions for `SUVI <https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/goes-solar-ultraviolet-imager-suvi>`__:

  * :func:`sunkit_instruments.suvi.read_suvi` to read FITS or NetCDF SUVI files.
  * :func:`sunkit_instruments.suvi.files_to_map` to read SUVI files and turn them into :class:`sunpy.map.GenericMap`.
  * :func:`sunkit_instruments.suvi.despike_l1b_file` and :func:`sunkit_instruments.suvi.despike_l1b_array` to despike SUVI L1b files.
  * :func:`sunkit_instruments.suvi.get_response` to get the response function for a given SUVI L1b file or wavelength. (`#61 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/61>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fermi pointing file names changed from "_p202_v001" to "_p310_v001" upstream. (`#48 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/48>`__)


0.2.0 (2021-02-13)
==================

Features
--------

- Add :func:`sunkit_instruments.rhessi.imagecube2map` function to extract `sunpy.map.MapSequence` objects from a RHESSI 4D image cube. (`#35 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-instruments/pull/35>`__)


0.1.0 (2020-09-30)
==================

Features
--------

- Creation of the package with all code from ``sunpy.instr``.
