def calculate_temperature_em(goes_ts, abundance="coronal"):
    """
    This function calculates the isothermal temperature and
    corresponding volume emission measure of the solar soft X-ray
    emitting plasma observed by GOES/XRS.

    These are calculated based on methods described in White et al. 2005 [1]_ (see notes)
    for which the GOES fluxes and channel ratios are used together with look-up tables
    of CHIANTI atomic models to estimate isothermal temperature and emission measure.
    Technically speaking, the method interpolates on the channel flux ratio using
    pre-calcuated tables for the fluxes at a series of temperatures for fixed emission
    measure.

    The method here is almost an exact replica of what is available in SSWIDL,
    namely, goes_chianti_tem.pro, and it has been tested against that for consistency.

    It now also works for the GOES-16 and -17 data, and for the re-processed netcdf
    GOES/XRS files for GOES 13-15.

    Also note that this has only been tested on the high resolutions 1s/2s/3s data of GOES/XRS.

    Parameters
    ----------
    goes_ts : `~sunpy.timeseries.sources.XRSTimeSeries`
        The GOES/XRS timeseries containing the data of both the xrsa and xrsb channels (in units of W/m**2).
    abundance: str, optional
        Which abundances to use for the calculation, the default is "coronal".
        Can be either "coronal" or "photospheric".

    Returns
    -------
    `~sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries`
        Contains the temperature and emission measure calculated from the input ``goes_ts`` time series.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from sunpy import timeseries as ts
    >>> import sunpy.data.sample  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> from sunkit_instruments import goes_xrs
    >>> goes_ts = ts.TimeSeries(sunpy.data.sample.GOES_XRS_TIMESERIES) # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> goes_flare = goes_ts.truncate("2011-06-07 06:20", "2011-06-07 07:30") # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> goes_temp_emiss = goes_xrs.calculate_temperature_em(goes_flare) # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

    Notes
    -----
    This function works with both the NOAA-provided netcdf files, for which the data is given in "true" fluxes
    and with the older FITS files provided by the SDAC, for which the data are scaled to be consistent with GOES-7.
    The routine determines from the `sunpy.timeseries.sources.XRSTimeSeries` metadata
    whether the SWPC scaling factors need to be removed (which are present in the FITS data).

    See also: https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/goes/goes.html#Temperature/Emission%20Measure

    In regards to the re-processed GOES 8-15 data, please refer to the documentation here:

        * https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/goes-space-environment-monitor/access/science/xrs/GOES_1-15_XRS_Science-Quality_Data_Readme.pdf
          This includes information of the SWPC scaling factors that were applied to prior data (e.g. the FITS data).

    Calculate isothermal temperature and emission measure from GOES XRS observations.

    This uses the latest formulated response tables including the responses for GOES1-17 to interpolate for temperature or emission measure
    from the measured true fluxes, which is read in from the FITS files goes_chianti_response_latest.fits.

    From the ratio of the two channels the temperature is computed from a spline fit from a lookup response table for 101 temperatures and
    then the emission measure is derived from the temperature and the long flux.

    Parameters
    ----------
    goes_ts : `~sunpy.timeseries.sources.XRSTimeSeries`
        The GOES XRS timeseries containing the data of both the xrsa and xrsb channels (in units of W/m**2).
    sat : `int`
        GOES satellite number.
    secondary: `int`, optional
        Values 0, 1, 2, 3 indicate A1+B1, A2+B1, A1+B2, A2+B2 detector combos for GOES-R.
        Defaults to 0.
    abundance: str, optional
        Which abundances to use for the calculation, the default is "coronal".
        Can be either "coronal" or "photospheric".
    remove_scaling: `bool`, optional
        Checks whether to remove the SWPC scaling factors.
        This is only an issue for the older FITS files for GOES 8-15 XRS.
        Default is `False` as the netcdf files have the "true" fluxes.

    Returns
    -------
    `~sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries`
        Contains the temperature and emission measure calculated from the input ``goes_ts`` time series.
        The two columns are:
            ``temperature`` : The temperature in MK.
            ``emission `measure` : The volume emission measure.
    Notes
    -----
    Requires goes_chianti_resp.fits produced by goes_chianti_response.pro
    This file contains the pregenerated responses for default coronal and photospheric ion abundances using Chianti version 9.0.1.
    url = "https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/gen/idl/synoptic/goes/goes_chianti_response_latest.fits"

    The response table within the fits file starts counting the satellite number at 0.
    For example, for GOES 15 - then 14 is passed to the response table. This is dealt within the code,
    the satellite number to be passed to this function should be the actual GOES satellite number.
